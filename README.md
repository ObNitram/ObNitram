## ⚜️Bonjour! I'm a French IT student. 🥖🇫🇷🥐

🎮 I started computing by creating a video game with Unity 3D. It was so engaging that I shifted my academic focus from engineering science to computer science. Undoubtedly the best decision of my life!💡

💻 Constantly eager to upgrade my skills! Dedicated to deepening my understanding of computer science and writing masterfully-engineered code.🚀

### 📱Involved in Flutter and Unity 3D.

### 🏰 I’m currently working on a Unity 3D mobile game!
